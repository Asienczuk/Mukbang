  <body> Hi Guys! Welcome to the 2016 Presidential Mukbang! Today, our contestants are Hilary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Donald Trump.  These contestants must compete to win the final reward which is $100,000,000.  Hilary Clinton hopes to give the money to her husband.  Bernie Sanders hopes to use the prize to pay off college tuitions.  Donald Trump(aka asshole-jk) hopes to use the money to build walls to isolate America from the rest of the human race.

    <h1>Rules for Mukbang</h1>
 So the rule is that each individual must choose only one unique dish to consume.  Based on the difficulty to eat the dish, they get a certain amount of compensation.  However, for those who are disqualified, the prize is then transferred to the Final Winner.  Any questions? Ok now let the Mukbang start!  Choose your character:
